Title: Osmosis

Equipment:
•	Potato
•	Cork borer or potato chipper/ vegetable stick cutter
•	Ruler
•	10 cm3 measuring cylinder
•	Labels
•	Boiling tube x 3
• Test tube rack
•	Kitchen Paper Towels
•	Scalpel
•	White Tile
•	Sugar solutions (0.1 M - 0.5 M)
•	Distilled water
•	Balance


Method:
1.	Use a cork borer to cut three potato cylinders of the same diameter.
2.	Trim the cylinders so that they are all the same length (about 3 cm).
3.	Accurately measure and record the length and mass of each potato cylinder.
4.	Label first, second and third boiling tubes '0.5 M', '0.25 M' and 'Water' respectively.
5.	Measure 10 cm3 of the 0.5 M sugar solution and put into the first boiling tube.
6.	Measure 10 cm3 of 0.25 M sugar solution and put into the second boiling tube.
7.	Measure 10 cm3 of the distilled water and put into the third boiling tube - This is the CONTROL.
8.	Add one potato cylinder to each boiling tube (make sure you know the length and mass of each potato cylinder in each boiling tube).
9.	Record the lengths and masses of each potato cylinder in a table such as the one below.

	0.5 M sugar solution	0.25 M sugar solution	Distilled water
Initial length (mm)
Final length (mm)
Change in length (mm)
Initial mass (g)
Final mass in (g)
Change in mass in (g)

9.	Place boiling tubes in test tube rack and leave overnight.
10.	Remove the cylinders from the boiling tubes and carefully blot them dry with the paper towels.
11.	Re-measure the length and mass of each cylinder (make sure you know which is which).
	Record your measurements in the table.  Then calculate the changes in length and mass of each potato cylinder.
12.	Plot a graph with:
  •	‘Change in mass in g’ on the y-axis
  •	‘Concentration of sugar solution’ on the x-axis
13.	Plot another graph with:
  •	‘Change in length in mm’ on the y-axis
  •	‘Concentration of sugar solution’ on the x-axis.
