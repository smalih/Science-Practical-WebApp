### Diary

This diary will help me keep track of progress made, and what needs to be done. At the end of this diary, there is an up-to-date list of tasks that need to be achieved.

10/01/2021 - Added frontend and backend support for username, and created a table in html for practical data. Idea is to process practical data as a pandas df and but convert it into sql before storing it in the practical data db (need to add a results df column).
             Next step si to figure out how to POST data from the html table to the backend, convert it into a pandas df (to use for plotting with numpy) and then convert it into sql.
        



### Tasks:
<ul>
  <s><li>Add a column to practical data db that stores practical data pandas df</li></s>
  <li>Create a practical data table that will store practical data read in from pandas df</li>
  <li>POST data from the html table to the backend</li>
  <li>Convert data into a pandas df (to use for plotting with numpy)</li>
  <li>Connvert data into SQL for storage in practical data db</li>
  <li>Design and code logic for plot_practical method - Are there better alternatives for more sophisticated data visualisation?</li>
  <li>Unit Testing</li>
</ul>
